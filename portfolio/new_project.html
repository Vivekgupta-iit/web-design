        <h1 class="mt-4">Intrusion-Detection-System</h1>
        <h2 class="mt-4">Project Title</h2>
        <p class="lead">An IDS is basically a software or device that is categorised into two common parts one is NID i.e. Network Intrusion Detection and second is HID i.e. Host Intrusion Detection. The work of both the NID & HID is same but their level is different. But IDS are categorised into 5 types – NIDS, HIDS, PIDS, Hybrid IDS & APIDS. Work is same to detect intrusions but they are used at different levels</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this project I have implemented Intrusion Detection System by creating 3 different networks as in Fig 1.2. Implementing the IDS is very challenging task as it needs the implementor to have proper knowledge with prior knowledge with some common and special network devices and ethernet cables. One have to know that how to deal with the CLI i.e. Command Line Interface. As I am performing this project on Cisco Packet Tracer – A best available simulation tool which allows users to see the working of network in real time. 
 
A layout of the network should be made prior to the implementation of IDS as I’m implementing NIDS. There are various parameters which are to be kept in mind while I designed network and configure IDS. Here are some ‘can’s and ‘can not’s about the IDS. 
 
-	CAN recognize and report alterations to data. 
-	CAN detect when your system is under attack. 
-	CAN detect errors in your system configuration. 
-	CAN NOT analyse all the traffic on a busy network. 
-	CAN NOT prevent system from that attack which it detects. 
-	CAN NOT deal with some of the modern network hardware and features.
